      <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <h3>For Hosts</h3>
        <p>Firstly the hosts will have to register. After registration the host will be able to upload the spaces for stay or parking.
        The host will be able to access the admin panel by going to my profile. In admin panel the hosts will be able to upload the spaces, edit the spaces and delete the spaces </p>
        <h3>For Guests</h3>
        <p>There is option for guests to get register or not. The guests will also have facility to check the spaces for stay or parking without registering. They will be able to access the phone number of hosts who have uploaded the properties.</p>
